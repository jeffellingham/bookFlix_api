# BookFlix API

## Objective
Build the backend/server-side of a "movies" web application that will ultimately use the MERN stack. I decided to narrow the scope of the app with the theme/niche of movies based on books (novels, comics, short stories, etc). The web app will provide users with access to a plethora of information on movies, including the directors, genres, actors, plot, and more. Users will be able to register for an account, update their personal information, maintain a list of their favorite movies, and more!

## Features

- Return a list of ALL movies to the user
- Return data on a single movie by title, including its description, genre, director, actors, release year, and an image.
- Return data about a genre by name
- Return all movies of a genre by name
- Return data about a director by name, including their bio, birth year, and death year (if applicable).
- Return all movies with a director by name
- Return all movies with an actor by name
- Allow users to register, and existing users to deregister
- Allow users to add and/or remove a movie from their list of favorites
- Allow users to update their account info (username, password, and date of birth)

## Tech
I'm using the MERN stack with this web app. For this backend portion I used Node.js and Express for the REST architecture, and built a NoSQL database using MongoDB.
