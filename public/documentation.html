    <h1>bookFlix Documentation Page</h1>
    <p class="intro">The bookFlix api will initially be a provider of information about various movies based on novels, comics, manga, or other formats of the written word. It'll include information on the movie, directors, actors, genres, and more. Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies from the site's selection. Our selection will be sparse in the beginning, though we plan to continually add all your favorites!</p>
    <p class="intro">The dream for the future of bookFlix is for it to become an invaluable resource for users to catalog, rate, and rank every movie (and hopefully TV shows too!) they've watched and be able to use the app to find recommendations on what to watch next.</p>
