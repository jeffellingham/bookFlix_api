    <h1>neXup Documentation Page</h1>
    <p class="intro">The neXup app will initially be a web application that provides users with information about various movies, directors, actors, genres, and more. Users will be able to sign up, update their personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies from the site's selection.</p>
    <p class="intro">The dream for the future of neXup is for it to become an invaluable resource for users to catalog, rate, and rank every movie and show they've watched and be able to use the app to find recommendations on what to watch next.</p>
